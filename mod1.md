## 🎯 Mod Purpose

Fantasy Reborn HQ aims to **significantly alter the core feel of No Man’s Sky** by improving variety, unpredictability, and scale across the universe.

Main goals:

* Reduce planet repetition
* Increase biome and color diversity
* Enhance fauna size and behavior
* Make exploration feel less procedural and more organic
* Combine multiple Redmas mods into a single coherent package

This is not a lightweight tweak, but a **deep modification of world generation and gameplay systems**.

## 🌍 Universe & Planet Generation

* Reworked planet generation rules
* Increased biome differentiation

## 🐾 Fauna & Creatures

The mod prioritizes **visual variety and atmosphere** over strict realism.
